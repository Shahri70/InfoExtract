        "The embeddings are produced by a pretrained neural language model. There are different ways to perform pretraining. A common approach is to show the model pairs of sentences that are deemed to be similar. For instance, this could be two sentences that occur in the sam Wikipedia article. The exact pretraining procedure and training data is different for each language model.\n",

These embeddings can then be compared e.g. with cosine-similarity to find sentences with a similar meaning. This can be useful for semantic textual similar, semantic search, or paraphrase mining. The framework is based on PyTorch and Transformers and offers a large collection of pre-trained models tuned for various tasks. Further, it is easy to fine-tune your own models.'
